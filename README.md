**Video2Anim** is my project for the final assignment in Emurgo Academy's Haskell Development Professional course.

---

## üìù assignment specifications and notes

The app is due in 3 weeks and will be presented before the class 3 weeks later. The parameters as laid out seem fairly simple.

### ‚úÖ project must include

- Monad Transformers
- Writer for logging
- Reader for config/constants
- State for state management
- IO for side-effects
- In the Writer, use Data.Text instead of String
  - Read about OverloadedStrings ghc extension
- Use cabal, stack, or nix to build
- split code into modules
  - study modularity of open source haskell projects on github
- build anything following these guidelines

### üß∞ misc suggestions from our instructor, Shaurya

- decide the project early
- scope it well
- break into chunks to build iteratively
- write unit tests (optional)
  - examine how others write tests

## üé¨ my chosen application

Video2Anim, a somewhat trivial Haskell program, takes a video file as input, separates frames into still images, adds an effect or stack of effects to each, then reconnects the images into an output video and/or gif.

---

This application may be further developed alongside my Haskell and Plutus knowledge.
